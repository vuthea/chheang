## About Me

Dr. Vuthea Chheang joined the Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 2023 as a postdoctoral research staff. His expertise areas are virtual and augmented reality, human-computer interactions, and visualization. His research interests include interaction and visualization techniques, collaborative environments, where multiple users can interact and collaborate seamlessly in the virtual environment, and medical applications for medical planning and training.

Vuthea got his doctoral degree in computer science from the University of Magdeburg, Germany in August 2022, working with Prof. Dr. Christian Hansen and Prof. Dr. Bernhard Preim. He also holds a Master of Engineering in computer science from Chungbuk National University, South Korea in 2018, and a B.Sc in computer science and engineering from the Royal University of Phnom Penh, Cambodia. 
Before joining the lab, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Delaware, and a research scientist at Research Campus STIMULATE, University of Magdeburg, Germany. He published more than 20 peer-reviewed publications related to applying virtual and augmented reality to support medical education, training, and team collaboration as well as domain-specific applications.
